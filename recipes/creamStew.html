        <p>
            <li><strong>Cream Sauce</strong></li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups (475ml) milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><strong>Seasoning</strong></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>

        </p>
        </p>
        
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken and Broth:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large pot, bring the chicken broth to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Add the bay leaf and chicken pieces. Cook until the chicken is tender and fully cooked, about 10-15 minutes. Remove the chicken and set aside, keeping the broth in the pot.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Vegetables:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, and onion to the pot with the chicken broth. Simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Make the Cream Sauce:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for about 1-2 minutes to make a roux.</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring there are no lumps. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt, pepper, thyme, and parsley.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Finish:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the cooked chicken, peas, and corn to the pot with the vegetables. Pour in the cream sauce and stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Ladle the creamy stew into bowls and serve hot. Enjoy the comforting and rich flavors reminiscent of Arrietty's small yet enchanting world.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
